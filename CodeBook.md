The resulting dataset includes summary measurements for each one of the 30 subjects for each activity on Acceleration and Velocity.

Each record in the dataset has:
* subject: a number from 1 to 30 that corresponds to the volunteer
* activity: indicates one of the six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) that the subject was performing wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

* This is followed by the Mean Value and the Standard deviation for each of the following Triaxial acceleration (taken from the accelerometer) and Triaxial velocity (taken from the gyroscope) variable:
  * tBodyAcc-XYZ
  * tGravityAcc-XYZ
  * tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * tBodyGyro-XYZ
  * tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
  * tBodyAccMag
  * tGravityAccMag
  * tBodyAccJerkMag
  * tBodyGyroMag
  * tBodyGyroJerkMag
  * fBodyAcc-XYZ
  * fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
  * fBodyGyro-XYZ
  * fBodyAccMag
  * fBodyAccJerkMag
  * fBodyGyroMag
  * fBodyGyroJerkMag
